# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Update the `regenerate_depgen_extension` task so that it does not pass the `--quiet` parameter to the underlying depgen command execution. Passing the `--quiet` flag resulted in some useful messages being omitted from the output when the task was run from the command line which ultimately led to problems identifying the cause of errors.

* The `data` attribute is not supported on the `j2cl_library` rule but leaf dependencies had this attribute added when the `verifyConfigSha256` option is `true`. To work around this limitation the output has been adjusted to generate an additional `java_import` rule with the `data` attribute specified and the `j2cl_library` was updated to use the `java_import` in the `srcs` attribute.

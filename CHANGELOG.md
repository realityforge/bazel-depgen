# Change Log

### [v0.08](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.08) (2019-07-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.07...v0.08)

* Fix the `WORKSPACE` file generated by the `init` command so that it correctly references the generated Bazel extension.

### [v0.07](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.07) (2019-07-28)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.06...v0.07)

* Fix the `init` command so that it does not require that the config file be present before the command is executed.

### [v0.06](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.06) (2019-07-27)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.05...v0.06)

* Upgrade the `org.realityforge.guiceyloops` artifact to version `0.102`.
* Upgrade the `au.com.stocksoftware.idea.codestyle` artifact to version `1.14`.
* Add the `includeExternalAnnotations` configuration to the global configuration and to per-artifact configuration. This configuration controls whether the `annotations` classifier artifact is downloaded. The `annotations` classifier artifacts is used by IntelliJ IDEA to store annotations outside the source code. This is particularly useful for IDEA users so annotations can be added to indicate the language of strings, expected patterns of strings, expected flags for strings etc. These annotations can be added without adding additional IDE-specific dependencies to the source code. If the the `annotations` classifier artifact is not found in the remote repository but the `includeExternalAnnotations` configuration is `true` it is not considered an error and is silently ignored.
* Add the `init` subcommand that initializes a `dependencies.yml` and may optionally generate the associated `WORKSPACE` file if not already present and run the `generate` subcommand. The initialization process assumes that the current directory should contain the `WORKSPACE` file and that the `dependencies.yml` is in the standard location (i.e. `thirdparty/dependencies.yml`). Although the tool allows the specification of the configuration file via the standard means. i.e. Specifying `--config-file path/to/deps.yml` before the subcommand. The `init` subcommand will also accept the arguments `--no-create-workspace` to skip creation of the `WORKSPACE` file and `--no-generate`  to skip the execution of the `generate` subcommand after `init` completes.

### [v0.05](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.05) (2019-07-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.04...v0.05)

* Generate a more useful error message when the `hash --verify-sha256 ...` command fails and the configuration option `verifyConfigSha256` is `true`. The error message describes the action required to rectify the issue. The error message looks like:

> Content SHA256: 0A8DBED4B09238126BA5E065EB4E392A1B631FA1A20FCA9AE1DF5AA364F59C96 (Expected 1DF387350EB57FD368BBF68EB397334B6241B5BBA816B67CF10BC69BEC541F07)
  Depgen generated extension file 'thirdparty/dependencies.bzl' is out of date with the configuration file 'thirdparty/dependencies.yml.
  Please run command 'bazel run //thirdparty:regenerate_depgen_extension' to update the extension.

### [v0.04](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.04) (2019-07-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.03...v0.04)

* Fix a bug where targets for replacements were always prefixed with a `:` character which made it possible to use labels with a path or repository. Now the targets defined in config file must resolve without this prefix but can be any arbitrary label.

### [v0.03](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.03) (2019-07-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.02...v0.03)

* Update the `regenerate_depgen_extension` task so that it does not pass the `--quiet` parameter to the underlying depgen command execution. Passing the `--quiet` flag resulted in some useful messages being omitted from the output when the task was run from the command line which ultimately led to problems identifying the cause of errors.
* Update the `regenerate_depgen_extension` task so that the user can provide arbitrary parameters to the depgen tool by passing them on the commandline. i.e. `bazel run //thirdparty:regenerate_depgen_extension --  --reset-cached-metadata` will pass `--reset-cached-metadata` to the underlying tool.
* Fix bug where the output as a result of the `--help` argument was omitted if the tool was also passed the `--quiet` argument.
* If a depgen artifact is explicitly declared then it **MUST** have the `all` classifier. This is now validated.

### [v0.02](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.02) (2019-06-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/v0.01...v0.02)

* The `data` attribute is not supported on the `j2cl_library` rule but leaf dependencies had this attribute added when the `verifyConfigSha256` option is `true`. To work around this limitation the output has been adjusted to generate an additional `java_import` rule with the `data` attribute specified and the `j2cl_library` was updated to use the `java_import` in the `srcs` attribute.

### [v0.01](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/tree/v0.01) (2019-06-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/bazel-depgen/compare/eb92a2dbd83e6f9c990baf0685f4d8781b10e686...v0.01)
